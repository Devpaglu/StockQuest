## Introduction:
This project is an AI-powered stock market simulation platform designed to provide users with a practical, immersive, and educational trading experience. Users start with a dummy balance and can trade real-time stocks using data fetched from APIs like Alpaca. The platform offers portfolio tracking, stock price visualizations, and contextual AI chat support that delivers insights based on news and financials of the selected company. A dedicated learning section guides users through stock market fundamentals with curated resources. Our standout feature is a smart trade analysis engine that provides detailed feedback, behavioral insights, and future recommendations after every trade â€” transforming the platform into a personal trading mentor. With dark mode UI and Clerk-powered authentication, the app delivers a seamless and intuitive user experience.
